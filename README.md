# AllergyFreePal
Team Member: shivani Singh; lupe Delgado; junhao Shen; peng Ge; Hang Shi.

#Scope:
A lot of people are allergic to certain food which can be commonly found in the menus of the restaurants. Our goal is to create a Website through which users will get information on which restaurant has an ingredient in their menu that might trigger the allergic reaction. 

#Communication
The team will be communicating via slack, whenever requirement arises. Apart from that, we will discuss the project work every wednesday,during the break and after the class. Also, all the team members will meet on saturday, every week, to discuss the status of the work done in the past week and what has to be done in the coming week.

#Review of Work
Each and every team member will complete the deliverables associated with their field of work and present them among the team members.
Other team members will provide feedback.
If required and possible, changes will be made one last time.
The person in charge will submit the final deliverable either before or on the due date, no later than that.
The team will be using platforms like PivotalTracker to manage and track our work, GitHub to collaboratively work on the development procedure and NetBeans as IDE.
